# Final-Project
OPTION of "Integrated Hosted Website and Computer App" or Sideloaded Android Project

---

Expectation: Integrated Promotional Website and Computer App
- Create a New GitHub Repository 
- Document finished and unfinished features and Easter Eggs
- Rewrite coding to better organize features already completed and provide guidance to how development of unfinished features might continue
- Note: GitHub already does this as a social media platform in branches / requests / merges
- Assignment: This website and Processing-Java reflection is more of a presentation summarizing how you read and organize the flow of algorithms in a main project
- "Features are related to how the code is organized and written"

Purpose: Promotion of Computer App, naming of feature and coding pieces into methods, documenting development in 
- Enable refection of coding to transition into CS30 (i.e. "every variable and every line of code is only written once")

Mandatory:
- Version Control: New GitHub Repository is created immediately and updated daily to demonstrate consistent work (irregular updates will decrease overall grade)
- Immediate submission to Google FORM (late submissions will be viewed as intention not to participate in class, decreasing grade)

Website Expectations: divided and organized into different pages with navigation
- Purpose of Computer App
- Description of Project
- Description of "Your" interest in this project ... state why you chose it (similar answer to "who you are as a person and why make this app" ... promotes you to others who are interested in collaborating
- All instructions on how to use your app - enabling testing and prototyping
- Finished feature list and Easter Eggs ( Each feature should be a webpage with descriptions about included algorithms and how it works )
- Unfinished feature list and Easter Eggs

- [BONUS]: use GitHub Markdown to organize and format documentation: https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation

CAUTION: this is not answering IF you can write algorithms ... it is about HOW
